    nasa-tlx : NASA Task Load Index (TLX) calculator

DESCRIPTION
-----------
    This program calculates the NASA task load index (TLX) as published by 
    S. Hart circa 1985. It uses the weighted average method, as opposed to more
    recent versions of the index that dispose of the factor weights. It's
    implemented in Python and makes use of wxWidgets/wxPython for the user
    interface. The only external library required to run the program is
    wxPython.

SOFTWARE DEPENDENCIES
---------------------
    Python
    wxPython

INSTALLATION
------------
    No installation is required at this time. The only method of running the
    program currently is directly from the 'src' directory in the distributed
    tarball.

USAGE
-----
    Calculating a TLX score with this program is extremely easy. First, start
    the program from the 'src' directory in the contents extracted from the
    distributed tarball:
    
        $ ./main.py
    
    The 'main.py' script will start a window titled NASA-TLX containing
    controls to adjust calculation parameters for the TLX score. The first
    section adjusts factor weights based on pair comparison of individual
    factors. The second section adjusts factor magnitudes. These sections and
    their use are described by S. Hart et. al., 1988.
    
    The program calculates the TLX score each time a factor is selected or
    magnitude changed.
    
    NOTE: at this time 'main.py' must be started from the 'src' directory.
