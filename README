nasa-tlx : NASA Task Load Index (TLX) calculator

This program calculates the NASA task load index (TLX) as published by S. Hart
circa 1985. It uses the weighted average method, as opposed to more recent
versions of the index that dispose of the factor weights. It's implemented in
Python and makes use of wxWidgets/wxPython for the user interface. The only
external library required to run the program is wxPython.

More to come, if and when time permits.
